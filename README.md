# sotrovimab-and-molnupiravir

This is the code and configuration for our ongoing research: "Effectiveness and safety of sotrovimab and molnupiravir for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes". The repository content has ONLY been made public to support the OpenSAFELY open science and transparency principles and to support the sharing of re-usable code for other subsequent users. The results have not been peer-reviewed.

* Our study protocol can be found [here](https://github.com/opensafely/sotrovimab-and-molnupiravir/blob/main/docs/OpenSAFELY%20Protocol_sotrovimab%20and%20molnupiravir_Git.pdf)
* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, are in `released_outputs/`
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org)
